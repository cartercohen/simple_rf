## Simple random forest models built with caret in R Studio.

The goal of this markdown file is to build a simple framework for implementing random forests through the caret package. Caret stands for Classification and Regression Training; it provides the necessary tools for data partitioning, pre-processing, feature selection, model tuning, and variable importance measures. I decided to work with the ranger implementation of random forest because it's fast and capable of handling high dimensional datasets. 

Caret has a variety of powerful tools for improving model performance and I'm looking forward to tackling classification and regression problems in my current position with XL: Fleet Electrification.
